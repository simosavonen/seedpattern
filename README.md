# seedpattern
Create a Voronoi diagram of a sunflower seed pattern using the golden ratio.

Demo at https://simosavonen.github.io/seedpattern/

Tip: use arrow keys to move the active slider with more precision.

Uses http://paperjs.org/examples/voronoi/ by adding the cell positions in code.

Inspiration came from trying to trace [this bitmap](https://momath.org/home/fibonacci-numbers-of-sunflower-seed-spirals/)
and the resulting SVG file being too heavy to import into CAD software such as Fusion 360. Also it would be nice to control the wall thickness and number of seeds drawn.
